### Expert CTF DLL code for Windows and Linux ###

* This is Expert CTF for Quake 2
* Version 4.0.5 is some slight bug fixes and system portability across Windows, Linux, OS X
* This code is forked from V4.0.3 code originally downloaded from http://expertctf.net/index.php?linkid=11&SELOPT=5
* Client side files are available from the expertctf.net site above.

### How to set up? ###

* git clone https://github.com/QwazyWabbitWOS/expertctf.git
* On Linux, make clean, then make.
* Dependencies: Visual Studio 2019 on Windows, or gcc/clang and GNU make on Linux
* On Windows with VS2019, use git clone per above, then open the .sln file with VS.
* This version compiles cleanly on Debian Linux GCC 4.3.2 and OS X 10.12.2 with Clang 8.0.0
* NOTE: the Debug directory will be created by cloning the repo, you'll need to delete it after your local repository is created, sorry about that. The .gitignore file wasn't up to date before I installed the repo here.
